# Correlation
Correlation is a statistical metric measuring to what extent different variables are interdependant.
Correlation doesn't imply causation.

```python
    sns.regplot(x="engine-size", y="price", data=df)
    plt.ylim(0,)
```

This creates a line. The steepness of the line and the separation of the values of the scatter plot from the line
imply if the two variables are positively, negatively or not correlated.
