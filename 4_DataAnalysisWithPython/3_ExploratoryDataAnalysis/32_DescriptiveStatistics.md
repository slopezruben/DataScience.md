# Descriptive Statistics
Explore data before modeling complex models.

Obtain and describe basic features of the set.

Example:
- ```df.describe()``` -> Shows the mean, std, total number of data...
- ```df.value_counts()``` -> Counts categorical data
- Box plots -> Shows the median, the quartiles and outliers
    - Can be used for comparing different groups
- Scatter Plot -> Each observation is described as a data plot in a discrete (non-continuous) manner. Show the relation between two variables.
    - Predictor on x-axis
    - Target on y-axis
